        <p>Hello there! My name is Samuel Fialho and Iâ€™m a front-end developer based in Lisbon and working
            full
            time now at Nuxeo. I'm a self taught developer with a focus on design. I love the web and that's
            why
            I'm working on it for 10 years now. I love systems and I consider myself a communication
