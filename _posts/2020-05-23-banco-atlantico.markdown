When Atlantico Bank was expanding in Europe it was important to reinforce and sustain the
company's culture and values. To do it, I was invited to think about a new strategy to
welcome new employees. Taking into account all the bank values, I've developed a concept based on
the advent calendar. Following a certain narrative, people would open some little boxes in which
were printed some key word definitions that were also connected to their on boarding in the
company. In each little box, there was an surprise object.
