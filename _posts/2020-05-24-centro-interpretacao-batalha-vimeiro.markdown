French invasions in Portugal were an important fact. CIBV is a museum that aims not only to
tell all the historical aspects of it, but also to explore new explanations for what happened
specifically in Vimeiro. To add an extra layer of interactivity to the physical structure,
we've created a mobile app to further extend the user experience. To do it, we apply a Design
Thinking approach, involving, from the very beginning, four groups of people, segmented to represent
our future users. The app was developed to iOS and Android.
